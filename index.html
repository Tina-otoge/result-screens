<h1>Rhythm games result screens comparison</h1>

<p>
	I wanted to compare the result screens of all major rhythm games to study their design choices.<br>
	Please note that the details added above each screenshot are not meant to be my analysis. They are here to add more information about the result screen that can not be conveyed by just a screenshot.
</p>

<p>
	Terminology:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gameplay screen: The state of the game where the notes are displayed and the player has to hit them.</li>
	<li>Result screen: The state of the game where the score is displayed.</li>
	<li>Transition: An animation displayed when the game switches from a state to another.</li>
	<li>Judge or judgement: Different judges represent different level of accuracy with which a note can be hit. Most games use something like "MISS", "OK", "GOOD", "GREAT", "PERFECT" with some variations.</li>
	<li>Fail: The conditions to clear the song were not met, usually the HP bar was below a certain level at the end of the song, or it reached 0.</li>
	<li>Clear: The conditions to clear the song were met.</li>
	<li>Fullcombo: No notes were missed.</li>
	<li>Perfect: All notes were hit with the highest judgement available.</li>
	<li>Grade: A way to reward the player for their score in an easy way to understand and compare, often based on the accuracy. Usually in the form of a letter from F to A. Most games use different grades for higher than A, such as AA and AAA, S, A+, etc.</li>
	<li>Early/Late or Fast/Slow: Tells the player the amount of notes that were hit after and before the timing required to get the highest judge.</li>
</ul>

		<p>In the case of a fullcombo, a circle is showed next to the grade. Its color represent the lowest judge achieved. Here the player on the left did some GREATs but no GOODs, so the circle takes the color of the GREAT judge, green. The player on the right did better and got no GREATs, so its circle is the color of the PERFECT judge.</p>
